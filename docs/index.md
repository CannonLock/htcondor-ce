HTCondor-CE 4 and 5
===================

The [HTCondor-CE](overview) software is a *Compute Entrypoint* (CE) based on [HTCondor](http://htcondor.org) for sites
that are part of a larger computing grid
(e.g. [European Grid Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/), [Open Science Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/)).
As such, HTCondor-CE serves as a "door" for incoming resource allocation requests â€” it handles authorization and
delegation of these requests to a grid site's local batch system.
Supported batch systems include
[Grid Engine](http://www.univa.com/products/),
[HTCondor](http://htcondor.org),
[LSF](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/hpc-workload-management),
[PBS Pro](https://www.altair.com/pbs-professional/)/[Torque](https://adaptivecomputing.com/cherry-services/torque-resource-manager/),
and [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).

# HTCondor-CE Certificate Mapfile
# http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.6/3_8Security.html#SECTION00484000000000000000
# Using GSI authentication for certificates requires the issuer CAs to be
# installed in /etc/grid-security/certificates. If you would also like to
# authenticate VOMS attributes, *.lsc files should be installed in
# /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/

# To configure authorization between HTCondor-CE daemons, uncomment and replace
# <HOST CERT DISTINGUISHED NAME> and <HOSTNAME>, (escaping any '/' with '\/')
# in the following line:
#
# GSI "^<HOST CERT DISTINGUISHED NAME>$" <HOSTNAME>@daemon.htcondor.org

# To configure authorization for users submitting jobs to your HTCondor-CE,
# uncomment and replace <DISTINGUISHED NAME> and <USERNAME> (escaping any '/'
# with '\/') with the distinguished name of the incoming user certificate and
# the unix account under which the job should run, respectively:
#
# GSI "^<DISTINGUISHED NAME>$" <USERNAME>@users.htcondor.org

# VOMS attributes can also be used for mapping:
#
# GSI "<DISTINGUISHED NAME>,<VOMS FQAN 1>,<VOMS FQAN 2>,...,<VOMSFQAN N>" <USERNAME>@users.htcondor.org

# You can use regular expressions for mapping certificate and VOMS attribute
# credentials.  For example, to map any GLOW certificate with the 'htpc' role to
# the 'glow' user, add a line that looks like the following:
#
# GSI ".*,\/GLOW\/Role=htpc.*" glow@users.htcondor.org
#
# The special token GSS_ASSIST_GRIDMAP indicates one should use the Globus Toolkit
# callout mechanism (which may involve plugins such as LCMAPS or Argus).
